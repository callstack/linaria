# API

Linaria exposes a core `css` method alongside with small, but just enough amount of helpers. Inside `@linaria/core` module you can find following methods:

## Client APIs

### `css`

String tag for tagged template literals consisting CSS code. The tagged template literal is evaluated to a unique class name by the Babel plugin:

```js
import { css } from '@linaria/core';

const flower = css`
  display: inline;
  color: violet;
`;

// flower === flower__9o5awv –> with babel plugin
```

All rules inside the template literal are scoped to the class name, including media queries and animations. For example, we can declare CSS animation like so:

```js
import { css } from '@linaria/core';

const box = css`
  animation: rotate 1s linear infinite;

  @keyframes rotate {
    { from: 0deg; }
    { to: 360deg; }
  }
`;
```

### `cx(...classNames: Array<string | false | void | null | 0>) => string`

Takes a list of class names and returns a concatenated string with the class names. Falsy values are ignored.

```js
import { css, cx } from '@linaria/core';

const cat = css`
  font-weight: bold;
`;

const yarn = css`
  color: violet;
`;

const fun = css`
  display: flex;
`;

function App({ isPlaying }) {
  return <Playground className={cx(cat, yarn, isPlaying && fun)} />;
}
```

Unlike the [`classnames`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames) library, this doesn't handle objects. If you want or need the features of the `classnames` library, you can use it instead.

### `styled`

Helper to build React components. It allows you to write your components in a similar syntax as [`styled-components`](https://www.styled-components.com/):

The syntax is similar to the `css` tag. Additionally, you can use function interpolations that receive the component's props:

```js
import { styled } from '@linaria/react';
import colors from './colors.json';

const Container = styled.div`
  background-color: ${colors.background};
  color: ${props => props.color};
  width: ${100 / 3}%;
  border: 1px solid red;

  &:hover {
    border-color: blue;
  }
`;
```

All rules inside the template literal are scoped to the component, similar to the `css` tag.

Dynamic function interpolations are replaced with CSS custom properties. A dynamic function interpolation will receive the `props` of the component as it's arguments and the returned result will be used as the value for the variable. When using this, a tiny helper is imported so that we don't duplicate the code for creating the component in all files.

You can also interpolate a component to refer to it:

```js
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 36px;
`;

const Article = styled.article`
  font-size: 16px;

  /* this will evaluate to the selector that refers to `Title` */
  ${Title} {
    margin-bottom: 24px;
  }
`;
```

If you want to swap out the tag that's rendered, you can use the `as` prop:

```js
// Here `Button` is defined as a `button` tag
const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
`;

// You can switch it to use an `a` tag with the `as` prop
<Button as="a" href="/get-started">
  Click me
</Button>;
```

You can also decorate another styled component with `styled`:

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
`;

// The background-color in FancyButton will take precedence
const FancyButton = styled(Button)`
  background-color: black;
`;
```

## Server APIs (`@linaria/server`)

### `collect(html: string, css: string) => string`

Takes HTML and CSS strings and returns the critical CSS used in the page by analyzing the class names. It can be used to determine critical CSS for server side rendering.

```js
import { collect } from '@linaria/server';

const css = fs.readFileSync('./dist/styles.css', 'utf8');
const html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(<App />);
const { critical, other } = collect(html, css);

// critical – returns critical CSS for given html
// other – returns the rest of styles
```

This will only detect critical CSS based on class names, so if you have any other type of selectors, they'll get added to the critical CSS.

Also note that extracting critical CSS this way will change the order of class names. It's not a problem if you're primarily using Linaria for styling. However if you're using a third party framework which imports its own CSS, then it's not recommended to use this helper on the extracted CSS.
