  # Migration Guide

  ## For Users

  The main breaking change is that all tooling has been moved from the `@linaria` scope to the `@wyw-in-js` scope. This means that you will need to update your dependencies as follows:

  | Old                      | New                       |
  | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
  | @linaria/babel-preset    | @wyw-in-js/babel-preset   |
  | @linaria/cli             | @wyw-in-js/cli            |
  | @linaria/esbuild         | @wyw-in-js/esbuild        |
  | @linaria/rollup          | @wyw-in-js/rollup         |
  | @linaria/shaker          | discontinued              |
  | @linaria/vite            | @wyw-in-js/vite           |
  | @linaria/webpack4-loader | discontinued              |
  | @linaria/webpack5-loader | @wyw-in-js/webpack-loader |

  There is no longer a need to install `@linaria/shaker` as it is now part of `@wyw-in-js/transform`, which will be installed automatically with the bundler plugins.

  The configuration file has been renamed from `linaria.config.js` (`linariarc`) to `wyw-in-js.config.js` (`.wyw-in-jsrc`).

  ## For Custom Processor Developers

  Base classes for processors and most helpers have been moved to `@wyw-in-js/processor-utils`.

  All APIs that had `linaria` in their names have been renamed:

  - The field that stores meta information in runtime has been renamed from `__linaria` to `__wyw_meta`
  - The export with all interpolated values has been renamed from `__linariaPreval` to `__wywPreval`
  - The caller name in Babel has been renamed from `linaria` to `wyw-in-js`
